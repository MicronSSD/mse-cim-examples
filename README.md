# MSE CIM Examples

This repository contains examples in several programming languages of how to communicate with the Micron CIM provider to interact with Micron SSDs.

The Micron CIM (Common Information Model) provider enables monitoring and management of Micron SSDs in enterprise environments.

Features include:
* View current drive health status, capacity, temperature, and firmware version.
* Update firmware.
* Erase non-encrypted drives.

The CIM provider is available as part of the Micron Plug-In for VMware ESXCLI release package, available [here](https://github.com/MicronSSD/esxcli-plugin/tree/master)
